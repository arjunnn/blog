It has been a great learning curve, given that it is my first real job and that I had to learn Python and Django, the stack the product is based on, from scratch.</p>\n<p>I immedidately fell in love with Python â€” it is a well designed, easy to understand language that is so flexible that a noob developer such as myself can start building apps in no time, and yet powerful enough to be used to solve complex scientific problems. Django felt quirky in the beginning but as I started using it, I realised how mature and fully featured the framework and its ecosystem is. Apart from these two, I also dipped my toes into PostgreSQL ðŸ¤ž, wrangled with Git ðŸ’ª, wept over Vim ðŸ˜«, made peace with Linux ðŸ˜‡, and mastered VSCode ðŸ¤“. </p>\n<p>Of course, writing code is only part of my job. I also had to sit through countless meetings, discussions and demos. I learned how important it is to plan out your work and strategy before writing even a single line of code. Iâ€™ve missed a good number of deadlines thanks to my poor planning. Although some of it can be attributed to my sub-par debugging and backtracking skills.<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> It is something I want to fix in 2019.</p>\n<p>My coworkers have been super supportive and helpful throughout and the structure of our team is such that often times we solve problems in collaborative, not-quite-pair-programming kinda ways. I also got to mentor a new member of the team for a few weeks. It was super fun, although I feel like I couldâ€™ve beeen more helpful and approachable to my mentee.<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Personal</h2>\n<p>I took a bunch of bite-sized vacations this year, and it was super fun to break away from work for a few days at a time and return energized. I Collected a ton of happy little memories from all the places â€” A road trip to Bangalore, a weekend getaway to Pondicherry, a weeklong trip to Delhi, and a day trip to Gulbarga. I realised that Iâ€™d been missing out on the fun of travelling and I will make an effort to travel more this year.</p>\n<p>Speaking of efforts, I really made an effort to be in touch with my close friends and spend time hanging out with them. Iâ€™m only now beginning to understand the value of deep, meaningful friendships and the effort it takes to foster them. My friends still think Iâ€™m not trying hard enough so this year it is going to be a quite a challenge ðŸ˜….</p>\n<p>Another effort I made(am making) is to form habits. One of my overarching goals is to be fluent in German by next year.\nSo Iâ€™m making it a habit to practice the language for 20 minutes everyday before bed.\nSimilarly, Iâ€™m strictly following the Pomodoro technique at work since the past few weeks and it has worked wonders for my productivity.\nI donâ€™t know what it is about the Human mind and incentive based stimuli, but it has worked wonders for my productivity.<sup id=\"fnref-4\"><a href=\"#fn-4\" class=\"footnote-ref\">4</a></sup> </p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p> The product I work on is <a href=\"https://biz.medleymed.com\">https://biz.medleymed.com</a>.
