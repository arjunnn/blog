It has been a great learning curve, given that it is my first real job and that I had to learn Python and Django, the stack the product is based on, from scratch.</p>\n<p>I immedidately fell in love with Python â€” it is a well designed, easy to understand language that is so flexible that a noob developer such as myself can start building apps in no time, and yet powerful enough to be used to solve complex scientific problems. Django felt quirky in the beginning but as I started using it, I realised how mature and fully featured the framework and its ecosystem is. Apart from these two, I also dipped my toes into PostgreSQL ðŸ¤ž, wrangled with Git ðŸ’ª, wept over Vim ðŸ˜«, made peace with Linux ðŸ˜‡, and mastered VSCode ðŸ¤“. </p>\n<p>Of course, writing code is only part of my job. I also had to sit through countless meetings, discussions and demos. I learned how important it is to plan out your work and strategy before writing even a single line of code. Iâ€™ve missed a good number of deadlines thanks to my poor planning. Although some of it can be attributed to my sub-par debugging and backtracking skills. It is something I want to fix in 2019.</p>\n<p>My coworkers have been super supportive and helpful throughout and the structure of our team is such that often times we solve problems in collaborative, not-quite-pair-programming kinda ways. I also got to mentor a new member of the team for a few weeks. It was super fun, although I feel like I couldâ€™ve beeen more helpful and approachable to my mentee<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Personal</h2>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p> The product I work on is <a href=\"https://biz.medleymed.com\">https://biz.medleymed.com</a>.
