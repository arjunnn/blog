In no particular order (maybe there should be one? ðŸ¤”), here is a list of things I want to learn:

*I will try and update this list as often as I can*

### Programming:

- Go
- Rust
- Elixir & Phoenix[^ Mostly because of this excellent post: https://schneider.dev/blog/elixir-phoenix-absinthe-graphql-react-apollo-absurdly-deep-dive/]
- GraphQL
- Functional Programming

### Other:

- German
- Building Habits[^ Been reading Atomic Habits by James Clear, such a good book on this topic. Highly recommend!]
- Learning - a meta skill [^ Hat tip to Naval in Tools of Titans by Tim Ferriss]

And when I start learning these things, I will do it publicly [^ Learn in Public: https://gist.github.com/sw-yx/9720bd4a30606ca3ffb8d407113c0fe5]
