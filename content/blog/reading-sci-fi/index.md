Came across this gem on twitter last week:

I just finished reading [Ready Player One](http://www.amazon.in/Ready-Player-One-Ernest-Cline/dp/0099560437/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1473148370&sr=8-1&keywords=ready+player+one) and this is similar to how I felt in some parts of the book. The book is laden with 80s pop culture references; most of which I've never heard of before. Not that I didn't like the book as a whole, but y'know.
