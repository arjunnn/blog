I'm **so** conflicted about Apple removing the 3.5mm headphone jack.
My concern isn't about *why* Apple had to do it, but *how* it chose to do it.
My problem with AirPods is that they're not as convenient as the EarPods they succeed.
I don't care about touch gestures or motion detectors in my headphones (at least not yet).
All I care for is for them to work. In any situation.
And I sure as hell can't take the AirPods to a run. I'd lose them in an instant.
Also I do not want yet another device to charge every <del>single day</del> **5 hours**. *5 hours of playback*? REALLY?

Thankfully, Apple didn't use all of its [*courage*](http://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12838024/apple-iphone-7-plus-headphone-jack-removal-courage) at once and decided to retain EarPods with lightning connectors. But what frustrates me to a great extent is that there is literally no way to charge your iPhone *and* use EarPods at the same time. Damn it, Apple. ðŸ˜ 

Of course, Apple has always been correct in its decision to cull obsolete technology (Read: Flash and optical discs).
But have they pushed it too far/soon this time? It will be interesting to watch the effects unfold.
