When I saw *Koi Mil Gaya* for the first time in 2004, it quickly became one of
my favourite movies.
It had elements such as an underdog to achiever storyline, aliens, friendship, and comedy.
The combination of all these, combined with Hrithik Roshan's brilliant performance won me over.
I hadn't yet seen *E.T.* then and this movie was the closest my 9yr old self had come to alien sci-fi adventure.

Over the years, among other things, the distinct theme music of the film stuck with me as did the computer interface used in the movie to communicate with aliens.

So as a tribute, I combined both of those to create **[Jadoo](http://arjun.ninja/jadoo)**, a web app that attempts to replicate the interface from the film. Works only in Chrome/Opera now. Try it with sound!
