`warning: strongly opionated piece ahead.`

I walked into *Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice* with resonable expectations (two dudes fighting) even though Essie Eisenberg's Lex Luthor, in the film's trailers says the following:

> The greatest gladiator match in the history of the world. God versus man. 
> Day versus night! Son of Krypton versus Bat of Gotham!

*phew!*

However, I felt like the movie overpromised and underdelivered. That doesn't necessarily mean that the movie is garbage; it has a few good tricks up its sleeve. 
Ben Affleck's portrayal of Batman is surprisingly convincing and adds to the dark and gritty tone of the movie.
Henry Cavill is likeable as Superman but the *Man of Steel* seemed depressed throughout. 
Gal Gadot plain kicks ass as Wonder Woman in the few scenes she has in the movie.
Amy Adams as Lois Lane feels like wasted potential.
My biggest gripe about this movie's casting is Essie Eisenberg as Lex Luthor(Jr?). 
He has a goofy, socially awkward and almost cartoonish personality and comes accross as annoying and out of place. 

Coming to the story, the movie picks up right where Man of Steel ends. 
Bruce Wayne's apprehension towards the Man of Steel and eventually, hate, is beautifully illustrated by Zack Snyder in the build up to the final combat. 
While it lasts the 'gladiator match' is immensely satisfying and fun to watch. 
However, it only lasts about 10 minutes and before you know it, it's over. 
While Batman's side of the story is nicely done, Superman's reason to fight does not seem well thought through. That is all that can be said without giving away spoilers.

*Dawn of Justice* tries to do too many things and mostly falls flat on its face because it does a poor job of tying them together. There are a couple of scenes in the movie that it is better off without, which would have reduced the overly long running time of the snooze-fest of first half.
It does however, set a solid foundation for the inevitable *Justice League* movies in the future with references to various charecters in DC Comics' massive universe(s). Some of these references are targeted at comic book nerds and aderent fans of the franchise.

In conclusion, *Dawn of Justice* is visually stunning and occasionally entertaining. Expect too much from it and you'll be thoroughly disappointed. Don't and you'll leave the cinema hall grinning ear to ear. It probably should've been called *Dawn Of Justice League* or something.
