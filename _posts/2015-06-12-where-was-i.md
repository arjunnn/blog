Have you ever been in a situation where you *had* to remember where you were on a particular day sometime in the past and you have no clue *at all*? Probably you were too ~~drunk~~ absent minded, like me. 


Don’t worry, I have faced this problem myself several times. So today, I created an automated tool(or recipe, if you prefer) using IFTTT that auto-magically saves your Foursquare/Swarm check-ins to your Google Calender. You're welcome.

So, what’s IFTTT? Short for ‘If This Then That’, it is a service that integrates your various accounts on the interwebz and makes your life easier, basically.

For example, want to save your every new selfie on Instagram to Dropbox? There’s a recipe for that!
Like a song on SoundCloud? You can make IFTTT download it  to your Dropbox!

There are **tons** of recipes out there, ~~literally~~ . [Go check it out](https://ifttt.com)!


Now, back to my recipe. Here it is:

Put the internet to work for you.
