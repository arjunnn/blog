I recently migrated my blog from Tumblr to GitHub hosted Jekyll blog. I will try to explain the *why* here.
It all started with my old blog on [Tumblr](http://munjlr.tumblr.com). Tumblr is great for sharing amazing/weird GIFs, jokes, photos et cetera.
I, however dislike the idea of blogging on tumblr to share technology related articles.

As awesome as Tumblr is, it has its pitfalls.
It often becomes a cesspool of re-blogged content and original posts are lost somewhere along the way.
<!--Discoverability of something as niche as my own thoughts on technology is practically zero. -->

I then contemplated setting up a self-hosted WordPress blog.
WordPress is pretty straightforward & easy to use.
Plus, I had previous experience with the platform thanks to [kMITRA](http://arjun.ninja/blog/my-journey-with-kmitra).

But I wasn't fully convinced. I wanted something better. I wanted to [blog like a hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html).
