## Intro

Over the last week, I built a fun&trade; and cool&trade; web app to draw doodles and simple drawings.
I appropriately named it **Sketch**. You can check it out here: [https://sketch.arjun.ninja](https://sketch.arjun.ninja)

## Why

I got the idea for Sketch while I was checking out the [article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) for HTML5 Canvas on MDN.
Now why was I doing that? Because I recently completed Wes Bos' [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) course (great course btw, highly recommend!) and used Canvas element in one of the course lessons.
I was immediately blown away by its capabilities and potential.
So to dig deeper, I scoured the internet for resources and found myself on MDN.

## Process

First, I noted down the functionality my app would provide:

Here's an initial UI mockup:

I started by building whatever I had learned during the Canvas course.
With little effort, I had a canvas to draw on and a function to listen to mouse events.
