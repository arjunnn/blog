Clearly, I was so busy that a lock-down caused by a global pandemic was the only thing that could free me enough to publish this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>😉</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Work</h2>\n<p>I continued to grow as a developer and learned where my interests lie in the vast world of software engineering.</p>\n<p>Around the middle of the year though, I grew frustrated with my employer, as did my teammates, for a myriad of reasons. Before I knew it, I <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_burnout\">burned out</a>. And so, I quit my job. </p>\n<p>A couple of days later, I accepted an offer from Melvault, where I currently work at. It’s been 7 months to this date and it’s been amazing! Some things I learned so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Navigating through a large, mature codebase for an enterprise product.</li>\n<li>My debugging skills have vastly improved. By improved I mean I’ve gone from littering my code with <code class=\"language-text\">print(&#39;here&#39;)</code>s to actually using all the amazing debugging tools available in modern IDEs.</li>\n<li>Asking for help. It might seem strange but I’ve only now learned to ask for help after exhausting all other options to solve a problem.</li>\n<li>How much you can enjoy your work when you have a supportive manager.</li>\n<li>I’ve realized that working from home, with dedicated focus blocks, is the best way for me to be productive. I’m now much better at finishing tasks within deadlines and due dates.</li>\n<li>I’ve given up on my fight against <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jira_(software)\">JIRA</a> and I now realise that it is a necessary evil to get the job done.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2>Personal</h2>\n<h3>Some things were good this year:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>🛹 I bought a skateboard on a whim and learned to ride it in a couple of days!</li>\n<li>🏃‍♂️ <a href=\"\">I took part in a marathon,</a> something I’ve wanted to do since school.</li>\n<li>⌨ After learning to type last year, I got into the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/\">wonderful mechanical keyboard community</a> and bought my first “clicky keeb” and I love it!</li>\n<li>🥰 My personal life and relationships have never been better, the pieces are falling in place for a future I’ve only dreamt of.</li>\n<li>💸 I’ve gotten serious about long-term investing and the magical power of <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compounding.asp\">compounding</a>.</li>\n<li>😴 On average, I’m sleeping better and more consistently and its effects are quite evident on my physical and mental health.<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup></li>\n<li>🚶‍♂️ Walked more this year than I ever did before, for an average of ~7000 steps a day.</li>\n<li>👯‍♀️ Spent more time with friends.</li>\n<li>💗 Started tracking my heart rate and sleep quality 24/7. It’s insightful to see trends over a period of time to reflect on specific situations etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Some were not so good:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>🚫✈ Did not travel <strong>at all</strong> this year.</li>\n<li>🚫📚 Read fewer books this year.</li>\n<li>🚫⚛ Wrote less javascript that I would’ve liked to.</li>\n<li>🚫🚀 Did not ship a single project. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Things I hope to do in 2020:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>💪 Exercise regularly to build core strength and stamina.</li>\n<li>🚀 Ship something, anything!</li>\n<li>\n<p>🌱 Be mindful about what I eat. After all:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>there is no such thing as a ‘bad’ or ‘unhealthy’ food, just an unhealthy diet. <sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>🦉 Get serious about learning at least one new language.</li>\n<li>📚 Read more books.</li>\n<li>🎮 Play more games. I’ve been missing out on the fun and thrill of video games.</li>\n<li>✈ Travel, for my own sanity.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p> All thanks to this book, Why We Sleep: <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963\">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963</a></p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Botanygeek/status/1029653068638572544\">https://twitter.com/Botanygeek/status/1029653068638572544</a></p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"title":"2019 In Review","date":"April 24, 2020","tags":["personal","year in review"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2019-in-review/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/work-log/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Using a Work Journal","tags":["programming","howto","productivity"],"date":"April 24, 2020"},"excerpt":"Since early last year, I’ve started maintaining a work journal, a simple markdown file to keep track of my work throughout the day.
